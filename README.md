# Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to determine the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in text data. In this case, we focus on restaurant reviews to understand whether customers' opinions are positive, negative, or neutral.

## Data Collection

To perform sentiment analysis, we collected a dataset of restaurant reviews from various sources such as Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Google Reviews. The dataset includes text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP tasks. It involves tasks like text cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling rare words. We have provided scripts and notebooks in the repository to help you preprocess the data effectively.

## Feature Extraction

In this project, we experiment with various feature extraction techniques, including Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe. These features are used to represent the text data in a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

## Model Building

We explore different machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment analysis. Some of the popular models we implement include:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transformer-based models like BERT

## Model Evaluation

We provide tools and notebooks to evaluate the performance of sentiment analysis models. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices are used to assess the models' effectiveness. You can choose the best-performing model based on your specific requirements.

## Deployment

If you want to deploy the sentiment analysis model in a real-world application, we offer guidance and resources for deploying models using Flask, Docker, or cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

## Usage

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-reviews-sentiment-analysis.git`
- Follow the provided documentation and notebooks to train, evaluate, and use the sentiment analysis models.
- Customize the code and models according to your specific needs.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community. If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new features to add, please submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the changes you would like to make.
